## Project structure

This project includes two main parts:

- Backend: Node.js and Express application connected to Azure Cosmos DB.
- Frontend: Angular application served through Azure Static Web Apps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- An Azure account (sign up here).
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine.
- Angular CLI installed for building the frontend.
- Azure CLI installed for managing Azure resources from the command line.
- Git for version control.

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/UnpredictablePrashant/ResumeAI.git
cd ResumeAI
```

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory

    `
     cd ResumeBuilderBackend
    `

3. Create an environment file (.env) with the necessary configuration variables. Refer to Environment Variables for more details.

4. To run the backend locally, you can use Docker. Create a Dockerfile with the following contents:
   
```
Copy code
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm install -g typescript
RUN npm run build
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y chromium
EXPOSE 4292
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```
4. Build and run the Docker container:

```
docker build -t resumeai-backend .
docker run -p 4292:4292 --env-file .env resumeai-backend
```
## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   
`
cd ResumeBuilderAngular
`

2. Create an environment file (.env) with the necessary configuration variables. Refer to Environment Variables for more details.
   
3. To run the frontend using Docker, create a Dockerfile with the following contents:
   
 ```
Copy code
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install -f
EXPOSE 4200
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "npm run generate-proxy-config && npm start"]
```

4. Build and run the Docker container:
   
 ```
  docker build -t resumeai-frontend .
  docker run -p 4200:4200 --env-file .env resumeai-frontend
 ```

5. Environment Variables:
   
For both backend and frontend, you need to configure environment variables as follows:

 Backend .env Variables
- JWT_SECRET_KEY: A secret key for signing JWT tokens. Example: MYREALLYSECRETKEY
- MONGO_URL: MongoDB connection URL. Example: mongodb+srv://...
- OPENAI_KEY: OpenAI API key. Example: YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
- GMAIL_USER: Gmail address used by Nodemailer to send resumes. Example: youremail@gmail.com
- GMAIL_PASS: Password or App Password for the Gmail user.
- FRONT_END: URL of the frontend. Example: http://192.168.1.96:4200

 Frontend .env Variables
- API_TARGET: URL of the backend API. Example: http://192.168.1.96:4292

## Deployment to AKS

1. Create Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster:
   
```
 # Create resource group once login to AZ using `az login`
 az group create --name <AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP> --location <AKS_LOCATION>
 # Create AKS cluster
 az aks create --resource-group <AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <AKS_CLUSTER_NAME> --node-count 2 --node-vm-size Standard_DS2_v2 --generate-ssh-keys
```

2. Configure kubectl to use your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster:
   
```
kubectl config use-context {AKS_CLUSTER_NAME}
```

3. Create Kubernetes deployment and service files for both frontend and backend using helm.
   
`
 helm create ResumeAI
`

4. Navigate to the helm directory, Apply the deployment:
   
```
cd ResumeAI
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
helm repo update
helm install resumeai ./resumeai
```

5.Verify the deployment:

```
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

To ensure the health and performance of your deployed MEAN application, you can set up a monitoring dashboard using Azure Monitor. These services will allow you to track key metrics, diagnose issues, and gain insights into your application.

### Set Up Azure Monitor Dashboard

**1. Create a New Dashboard**:

- In the Azure Portal, search for Azure Monitor and select Dashboards.
- Click on New Dashboard and give it a name (e.g., ResumeAI Monitoring Dashboard).

**2. Add Monitoring Metrics:**

Application Metrics: To monitor the backend performance:

- In the Dashboard settings, click Add a tile and choose Metrics.
- Select Application Insights as the source, then choose the appropriate metric (e.g., requests, failed requests, dependencies).

App Service Metrics: For tracking App Service health and usage:

- Click Add a tile and select Metrics.
- Select App Service as the resource, and then choose metrics like CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Response Time, etc.

Customize the Dashboard:

- Rearrange the tiles as needed to prioritize key metrics.
- Save the dashboard to quickly access it whenever you need to check the applicationâ€™s performance.

**Step 3: Key Metrics to Monitor**

The following key metrics are important for keeping track of your application's performance and health:

- App Service Metrics:

 - CPU Usage
 - Memory Usage
 - Response Time
 - Requests/Failures
 - Active Connections
